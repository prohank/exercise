 * 23/01/2022 - Solution tested with limited cases
 * A sentence is made up of a group of words. Each word is a sequence of letters, ('a'-'z', 'A'-'Z),
 * that may contain one or more hyphens and may end in a punctuation mark: period (.), comma (), question mark (?), or exclamation point (!).
 * Words will be separated by one or more white space characters.
 * Hyphens join two words into one and should be retained while the other punctuation marks should be stripped.
 * Determine the number of words in a given sentence.
 * Example
 * s = 'How many eggs are in a half-dozen, 13?'
 * The list of words in the string is ['How', 'many', 'eggs', 'are', in', 'a', 'half-dozen']
 * and the number of words is 7.
 * Notice that the numeric string, '13', is not a word because it is not within the allowed character set.
 * <p>
 * Function Description
 * Complete the function howMany in the editor below.
 * howMany has the following parameter(s):
 * sentence: a string
 * Returns:
 * int: an integer that represents the number of words in the string
 * Constraints
 * â€¢ 0 < length of s <= 10^5
